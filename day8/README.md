## Problem 1 of Day 8

Solved with [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), using [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

It's been two decent decades since the last time I worked with Prolog.

To run:

`swipl -q -s day8.pl -t prob1 < path/to/input_data`

Note that Prolog is doing a brute force search, therefore is slow. I intentionally kept each digits output
to make the wait less intolerable ;)

Of course, the first problem of day 8 doesn't really need any real cracking - 1,4,7,8 can be told by simply
checking string lengths. But what's the fun in doing that?

## Problem 2 of Day 8

To run:

`swipl -q -s day8.pl -t prob2 < path/to/input_data`
