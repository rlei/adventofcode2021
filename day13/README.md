# Day 13

Solved with [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/). This is my first OCaml program.

Sorry for the duplicated functions in both soluations. Just want to make each one is self contained without the hassle of creating a Dune project.

## Problem 1

To run:

`ocaml prob1.ml < path/to/input_data`

## Problem 2

To run:

`ocaml prob2.ml < path/to/input_data`
