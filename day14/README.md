# Day 14

Solved with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## Problem 1

To run:

`kotlinc -script prob1.kts < path/to/input_data`

Note `kotlinc` needs to compile the script each time when running. It's the compiling that's slow, not the program.

## Problem 2

While the solution to problem 1 was implemented in a naive way, problem 2 has a proper solution by not really building new full strings in each iteration.

To run:

`kotlinc -script prob2.kts < path/to/input_data`

Note `kotlinc` needs to compile the script each time when running. It's the compiling that's slow, not the program.
