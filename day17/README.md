# Day 17

Solved with [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

## Problem 1

Solved with Julia + [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) + [Bonmin](http://github.com/coin-or/Bonmin) as the (MI)NLP solver.

I gotta admit that I'm a Non-Linear Programming noob, but boy Julia + JuMP is fun.

To run:

`julia prob1.jl`

Note it may take a moment for the mentioned packages to be downloaded on the first run.

## Problem 2

Solved with Julia only, just some brute force loops.

To run:

`julia prob2.jl`
